# AP UI - WIP

A React component library of my most frequently used components across projects. 

## Motivation

Instead of recreating the same components, or copy pasting them from previous projects, I decided to build a component library that features my most commonly used components. From primitives to fully-loaded components, the goal is to increase my productivity in building things. I'll eventually turn this into an NPM package so that I can simply install it as a dependency for my other projects.

## Tech stack

- React 19
- TailwindCSS
- Tailwind CLI
- Motion (Framer Motion)
- Tsup
- Jest & RTL
- Turborepo

### This README will be adjusted through the development process.
